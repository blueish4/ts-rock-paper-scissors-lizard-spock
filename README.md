# RPSLS (Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock)

A fun little implementation of this simple game using TypeScript.
The main game logic can be imported for any other game client type, but a simple
browser-based client is also provided. It was written as part of a skills test
for a job application, and as such I'm not invested in spending time maintaining
it but you can totally browse the code and use whatever you want.

## Building

Building the browser version is done using `npm run build`.

If just the modules are required, `tsc` should suffice.
